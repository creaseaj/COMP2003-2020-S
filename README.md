# Vulnerability Analysis and Pen-Testing Suite #
## COMP2003-2020-S ##

## About The Project ##
This repository contains the relevant files for our COMP2003 - Computing Project. As Cyber Security students, we opted to create an application relevant to security.

## Product Vision ##
Designed for Small-to-Medium enterprises whose systems may be vulnerable to attacks without realising, the Vulnerability Analysis and Pen-Testing Suite is a system testing kit. It searches for a range of vulnerabilities using traditional tools wrapped into one, user-friendly environment that outputs any results clearly and effectively.
